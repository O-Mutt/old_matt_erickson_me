As many of us do as software developers/engineers/hackers I have been to, answered and asked my share of questions on stackoverflow in my career. They also now have an invite careers section of their site. I joined recently and have since completed my profile to a point where they see fit to grant me some invites.


  


Not really much else to say but: <a href="http://bit.ly/TSr1ny" rel="external">Accept Careers 2.0 invite</a> =)
