My wife rocks

Most of you are thinking "well, there is always a reacher and a settler, right?" Yes, I agree.  And I stretched for the moon. Over the coming years I think we will see some real battles that will be fought for people who deserve to have every right to be, do, and succeed as their neighbor. I don't sit on one side of this fence, I am not with _her_, I'm not in on the 'Black/Blue Lives Matter' movement(s).  But without taking a side I can still support all of them. All of these movements have so much in common, love, common decency, following the golden rule, care about eachother.  I don't think any of this should be hard for us but apparently I am wrong.
