### September 11th

Let me start off this post by telling you a short story of my family and the date. Today is September 11th, 2012. Eleven years ago today, the United States had a terrible event occur by extremists from a religious group. I could go into my thoughts on this but no one actually wants to hear that, and that is not why you are here so onto the story.
  

I have three sisters, the middle, in age, of the three had a child when she was sixteen years old. When the child was born my uncle and his wife decided to adopt her. Fast forward a few years, my uncle was working as a radio show host in the south tower of the world trade center and his wife worked as a video editor (I believe). Well on the night of September 10th, 2001 Taylor, the little girl whom they adopted, came down with a stomach bug and was not able to go to daycare. This meant one of her parents wasn&#8217;t able to go to work, my uncle drew the short straw and stayed home. Later that morning the tower that he would have been working in fell. . .
  

These are the problems that we should care about and these are the problems that matter. Not the one I will do a short bit of complaining about here:
  

### Actual Post about Software Project Moves

On September 1st I left on my vacation back to Minnesota for my fathers wedding. I left work and knew my supervisor was going to be in charge of any bugs or issues that arose from my work that I had been doing over the last few weeks. I received a few emails with questions and comments while I was out of the office but nothing that a sentence or two couldn&#8217;t explain. Well, this morning I came into the office with a cup of coffee in my hand and a smile on my face ready to get back to work to be met with some news that, as of this point in the day I am still unsure of the polarity, good or bad. I have been reassigned to a different project and will be changing supervisors.
  

I look forward to the new challenges that await me on this new project and wish my past team good luck (although I will most likely still pester them as I always have).
