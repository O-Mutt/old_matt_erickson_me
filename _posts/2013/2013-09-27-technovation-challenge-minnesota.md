The other day I was pinged by a professor from my college about a potential opportunity to give back to the community who has nurtured my technical growth. She introduced me to two individuals who are growing a newer program in minnesota: <a href="http://www.codesavvy.org/p/technovation.html" title="Technovation" target="_blank" rel="external">Technovation Challenge</a>. This challenge is aimed at middle and high school females in an effort to give them opportunity to show off their technical savvy and a chance to learn a new skill. We will be using MIT&#8217;s App Inventor which is a drag an drop, block based programming language which lowers the barrier to entry for youth/adults in general. I am very excited about being a part of this program and helping Minnesota continue becoming a technology hub in the midwest.
